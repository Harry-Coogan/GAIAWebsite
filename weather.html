  <p>Fires happen naturally in many parts of the world. It's difficult to know if climate change has caused a specific wildfire to spread because other factors are also relevant, such as changing land use. </p>
  </div>
  <div class = "lgreen">
 <p> But climate change is making the weather conditions needed for wildfires to spread more likely, according to the UN's climate body, the IPCC.</p>
  </div>
  <div class = "dgreen">
 <p> Extreme and long-lasting heat draws more and more moisture out of the ground and vegetation.</p>
  </div>
  <div class = "lgreen">
 <p> These tinder-dry conditions provide fuel for fires, which can spread at an incredible speed, particularly if winds are strong.</p>
  </div>
  <div class = "dgreen">
  <p>Canada is experiencing its worst wildfire season on record, with 176,000 sq km (43.5 million acres) already burnt.</p>
  </div>
  <div class = "lgreen">
  <p>Climate change more than doubled the likelihood of the extreme "fire weather" conditions in eastern Canada that allowed the fires to spread, according to the WWA.</p>
  </div>
  <div class = "dgreen">
  <p>this is only one topic of many that weather and climate change could be about like longer droughts or longer heatwaves and the cons of having these.</p>
